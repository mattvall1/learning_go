--- Notes ---

Basic syntax rules:
- Variable and package names are lower and mixed case
- Package names should be single words, all lowercase
- Exported functions and fields have a leading capital letter
- Curly bracket MUST be on the same line as function definition (or preceding statement)

Memory allocation:
             The `new()` function                    |              The `make()` function
-----------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------
Allocates but does not initialize memory             | Allocates AND initializes memory
Results in zeroed storage + returns memory address   | Allocates non-zeroed storage + returns memory address
